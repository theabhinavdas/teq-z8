In this paper, we have implemented efficient JPEG (Joint Photographic experts group) Decoder on GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) using NVIDIA CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) Technology. This decoder is capable of decoding images of Ultra HD resolution with super fast speed GPU is used to assist the CPU for time-consuming tasks. In this paper IDCT module which consumes 70 to 80 percent of computation time is implemented on GPU. An asynchronous parallel execution between the CPU and the GPU is used at the same time to improve the JPEG decoder acceleration rate.
